## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

x<-c("Stately", "plump", "Buck", "Mulligan", "came", "from", "the", "stairhead", "bearing", "a", "bowl", "of", "lather", "on", "which", "a", "mirror", "and", "a", "razor", "lay", "crossed")

y<-c("Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed")

str_split(y, " ") 
#split the sentence by spaces into separate words

y2<-c(unlist(str_split(y, " ")))
#unlists the sentence so it is not one block of text
y2

extract<-y2[c(3,6,9,12,15,18,21)]
#extracts every element that is within the c()
extract
